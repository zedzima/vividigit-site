title = "Why SaaS Marketing Is Different"
text = """
SaaS companies face unique challenges that traditional marketing playbooks cannot solve. Your revenue depends on recurring subscriptions, which means acquisition is only the beginning — retention and expansion are equally critical.

The SaaS buyer journey is complex. Decision-makers research extensively, often through organic search, peer reviews, and competitor comparisons. Your marketing must be present at every stage, from the first Google search to the moment a trial user decides to enter their credit card.

We specialize in the metrics that matter: Customer Acquisition Cost, Monthly Recurring Revenue, Net Revenue Retention, and Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate. Every campaign we run ties directly to these numbers.
