[[faq.questions]]
question = "Do you need access to our site?"
answer = "Not for the initial crawl. We audit your site externally, just like search engines see it. If we find issues requiring backend access (like server logs or CMS settings), we'll request it separately."

[[faq.questions]]
question = "How is the audit different from free tools like Google's PageSpeed?"
answer = "Free tools check individual pages for specific metrics. Our audit covers your entire site systematically: crawlability, indexing, internal linking, content duplication, schema markup, Core Web Vitals, and more — across all pages."

[[faq.questions]]
question = "What happens after the audit?"
answer = "You receive a prioritized action plan. You can implement fixes yourself, have your dev team handle them, or hire us for specific fix tasks (like Site Speed Optimization or Schema Markup Setup)."
