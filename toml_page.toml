### Why this matters

When you design a system for humans, you must respect:
1. Their time,
2. Their attention,
3. Their ability to make informed decisions.

You can link to internal sections like [see the details](#details-section)
or external resources like [the guide](https://example.com/guide).

Placeholders like `{{user_name}}` must remain intact and not be translated.

You may want to describe a multi-level process:

1. Preparation:
   - Define your content blocks.
   - Agree on IDs with developers.
   - Decide which fields are translatable.

2. Implementation:
   - Store all text in TOML files.
   - Keep only semantic labels inside content.
   - Place images, formats and layout only in templates.

3. Governance:
   - Maintain a content style guide.
   - Add validation rules for each block.
   - Track updates and translations as part of workflow.

## How this TOML format is intended to be used

Each section of this file corresponds to a **content block**.
Developers map these block IDs (`hero`, `benefits`, `cta`, etc.)
to corresponding HTML templates.

Editors work only with:
- plain strings,
- Markdown multiline fields,
- arrays like lists or table rows.

They never touch:
- HTML tags,
- CSS classes,
- layout parameters like `width`, `height`, `loading`, `format`.

> This separation keeps the system safe:
> developers own the layout, editors own the meaning.

Inline placeholders such as `{{user_name}}` or `[[internal_id]]`
should remain unchanged and not be translated.
