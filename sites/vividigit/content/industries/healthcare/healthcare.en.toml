text = """
Healthcare is one of the most sensitive industries for digital marketing. Google holds medical content to its highest quality standards through YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) guidelines, and regulators impose strict rules on what you can claim, how you can advertise, and how patient data must be handled.

Generic marketing agencies often create healthcare content that either fails to rank because it lacks medical authority, or risks compliance violations because it makes unsupported claims. Neither outcome is acceptable when patient trust and regulatory standing are at stake.

Our healthcare marketing team combines SEO expertise with medical content knowledge. We understand HIPAA considerations for digital campaigns, E-E-A-T requirements for medical content, and the patient decision journey from symptom search to appointment booking.
