title = "Why Russian Digital Marketing Is a Separate Discipline"
text = """
Russian-language digital marketing operates in a fundamentally different ecosystem from Western markets. Yandex, not Google, remains a major search engine. VKontakte, not Facebook, is the dominant social network. Telegram, not WhatsApp, is the messaging platform of choice. Understanding this landscape is essential for reaching Russian-speaking audiences.

The Russian language itself presents unique challenges for marketers. With six grammatical cases, complex morphology, and significant differences between formal and colloquial registers, creating natural-sounding marketing copy requires native fluency. Keyword research must account for word forms that Western SEO tools simply do not handle.

Our Russian-language team combines native linguistic expertise with deep platform knowledge. We create campaigns that work within the Russian digital ecosystem, not against it — driving results on the platforms and through the channels that Russian-speaking audiences actually use.
