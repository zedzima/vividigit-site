title = "Why Japanese Marketing Demands Perfection"
text = """
Japan is the world's third-largest economy and one of its most sophisticated digital markets. Japanese consumers spend heavily online, but their expectations for quality, precision, and cultural appropriateness are among the highest in the world.

The Japanese language presents unique challenges that most marketing agencies cannot handle. Three writing systems (kanji, hiragana, katakana) are used together, and choosing the wrong script can change the tone or meaning of your message. Politeness levels in Japanese (keigo) must be calibrated precisely for your audience — too casual and you lose respect, too formal and you seem cold.

Beyond language, Japanese digital behavior has its own patterns. Yahoo Japan remains a major search engine, LINE is the dominant messaging platform, and Japanese consumers rely heavily on review sites and comparison content before purchasing. We build campaigns that work within these Japanese-specific patterns, not against them.
