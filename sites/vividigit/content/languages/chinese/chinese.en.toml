title = "Why Chinese Digital Marketing Is an Entirely Different World"
text = """
China's internet operates behind the Great Firewall, creating a parallel digital ecosystem that is largely inaccessible to Western tools and platforms. Google, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter do not function in mainland China. Instead, Chinese consumers use Baidu, WeChat, Douyin (TikTok's Chinese counterpart), Xiaohongshu (RED), and dozens of other local platforms.

For businesses targeting Chinese-speaking audiences, this means every assumption from Western digital marketing must be re-examined. SEO means Baidu optimization. Social media means WeChat and Weibo. Video marketing means Douyin and Bilibili. Even payment flows center on Alipay and WeChat Pay rather than credit cards.

Our Chinese-language team includes native Mandarin speakers with hands-on experience across China's digital platforms. We help businesses navigate this complex landscape — from ICP license requirements for hosting in China to content strategies that work within Chinese platform algorithms and cultural expectations.
