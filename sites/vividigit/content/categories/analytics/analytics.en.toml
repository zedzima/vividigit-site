title = "Why Analytics & Data Matters"
text = """
Without accurate data, every marketing decision is a guess. Yet the majority of businesses operate with incomplete tracking, misconfigured analytics, and attribution models that overcount or undercount channel performance. The result is misallocated budgets and missed opportunities.

Modern analytics goes far beyond pageviews and sessions. It connects the dots between ad clicks, website interactions, form submissions, and revenue. It reveals not just what happened, but why it happened and what to do next. With proper tracking and attribution, you can confidently scale what works and cut what does not.

Our analytics services start with getting the foundation right — accurate tracking, clean data, and reliable reporting. From there, we build custom dashboards that give your team real-time visibility and attribution models that help you allocate budget with precision. Every setup is designed for privacy compliance and future-proofed for a cookieless world.
