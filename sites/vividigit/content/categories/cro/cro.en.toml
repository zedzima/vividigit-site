title = "Why CRO Matters"
text = """
Most websites convert between 1% and 3% of their visitors. That means 97 out of every 100 people who visit your site leave without taking action. Even a small improvement in conversion rate can have an outsized impact on revenue — without spending a single additional dollar on traffic.

Conversion rate optimization is the discipline of systematically improving your website's ability to turn visitors into customers. It combines data analysis, user psychology, and rigorous experimentation to remove friction, strengthen messaging, and guide visitors toward the actions that matter to your business.

Our CRO process starts with a comprehensive audit that maps user behavior across your site. We identify the highest-impact opportunities, design experiments to test them, and implement the winners. Every recommendation is backed by data, and every change is validated through testing before it goes live. The result is compounding improvement that multiplies the return on all your other marketing investments.
