title = "Why Video Marketing Matters"
text = """
Video is the most consumed content format on the internet. Viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it on video, compared to just 10% when reading text. Across every platform — from YouTube to LinkedIn, from TikTok to your own website — video outperforms static content in engagement, time on page, and conversion rates.

The rise of short-form video has made the format more accessible than ever. You no longer need massive production budgets to create compelling video content. What you need is a clear strategy, consistent output, and an understanding of what each platform rewards. The brands that invest in video now are building audiences and engagement moats that will be difficult for competitors to match.

Our video marketing services span the full production pipeline. We help you define a video strategy aligned with your business goals, produce content across formats and platforms, and optimize distribution for maximum reach. Whether you need a flagship brand video, a weekly YouTube series, or a high-volume short-form content program, we handle it end to end.
