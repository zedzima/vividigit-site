text = """
Austria is often grouped with Germany, but it is a distinct market with its own business culture, media landscape, and consumer expectations. With nearly 9 million people and one of the highest GDP per capita figures in Europe, Austria offers significant opportunity for businesses willing to invest in proper localization.

Austrian consumers value quality, precision, and local relevance. Marketing that feels imported from Germany — even in the same language — often underperforms compared to genuinely Austrian-adapted content. The differences extend beyond vocabulary to tone, humor, cultural references, and business etiquette.

We help businesses navigate these subtleties, whether entering Austria for the first time or optimizing an existing Austrian presence for stronger local performance.
