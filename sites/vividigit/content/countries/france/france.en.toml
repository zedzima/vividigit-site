text = """
France is Europe's third-largest economy and second-largest e-commerce market. With 67 million people and one of the highest internet penetration rates in Europe, it represents an enormous digital opportunity — but one that demands cultural fluency.

French consumers are notoriously resistant to marketing that feels foreign or mass-produced. They expect polished, culturally relevant communication in proper French. Machine-translated content or American-style marketing copy will not only fail to convert but may actively damage your brand perception.

We combine native French language capabilities with deep market knowledge to deliver campaigns that feel authentically French. From SEO keyword research using actual French search behavior to PR outreach with French media, every element is adapted for local success.
