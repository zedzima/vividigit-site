Organic search drives over 50% of all website traffic. Unlike paid channels, SEO compounds over time — the work you invest today continues to deliver results months and years into the future.

## Our Approach

We combine technical excellence with content strategy:

- **Data-driven analysis** — every recommendation backed by research
- **Transparent reporting** — no black-box tactics
- **Measurable results** — every implementation tracked and measured

A well-executed strategy goes beyond just rankings. It improves user experience, builds brand credibility, and drives high-intent traffic that converts at significantly higher rates than most other channels.

<p>The Text block is for <strong>simple, free-form content</strong>. Write markdown or HTML and it renders with proper typography.</p>

<h3>Supported Elements</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Headings (h2, h3, h4)</li>
    <li>Paragraphs with <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em></li>
    <li>Bulleted and numbered lists</li>
    <li>Links and <code>inline code</code></li>
    <li>Blockquotes and code blocks</li>

    Use Text block for articles, descriptions, documentation, or any content that needs rich formatting without special layout.
</blockquote>

<p>Centered text works best for <strong>short, impactful content</strong> — introductions, mission statements, or key messages that need visual emphasis.</p>

<p>Combined with <code>narrow = true</code>, it creates a focused reading experience with optimal line length for readability.</p>

<blockquote>
    "Good design is as little design as possible."<br>
    — Dieter Rams
</blockquote>

<p>Use this variant when you want to draw attention to a specific message or create visual breathing room between dense content sections.</p>

<p>This variant uses <code>narrow = true</code> with left alignment. It's ideal for <strong>long-form articles</strong> where readability matters.</p>

<p>The optimal line length for reading is 50-75 characters. Narrow text blocks enforce this constraint automatically, making dense content easier to read.</p>

<h3>When to Use</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Blog posts and articles</li>
    <li>Documentation pages</li>
    <li>Terms and conditions</li>
    <li>Any text-heavy content</li>
</ul>

<p>For wider layouts with multiple elements, use the default full-width variant instead.</p>
