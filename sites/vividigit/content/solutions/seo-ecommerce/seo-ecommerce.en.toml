Online stores face unique SEO challenges that general SEO strategies don't address:

- **Duplicate content** from product variants and filters
- **Thin content** on category and product pages
- **Crawl budget** issues with large catalogs
- **Faceted navigation** creating infinite URL combinations
- **Out-of-stock products** and changing inventory

## Our Approach
