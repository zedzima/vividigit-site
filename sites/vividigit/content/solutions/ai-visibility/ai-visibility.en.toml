body = """
More companies are running into the same issue.

Their SEO performance is stable, their content ranks in search engines, yet when potential customers ask AI tools questions, **their business does not appear in the answer.**

Instead, AI responses often:

- Reference competitors
- Cite general informational websites
- Or include no business sources at all

The reason is not a sudden drop in quality. It lies in **how AI systems decide whether to reference external sources.**

Search engines ask: *"Which website should I show?"*

AI asks: *"Do I need a source to support this explanation — and if so, which one fits best?"*

Once this distinction is clear, AI citation behavior becomes much easier to understand.

[[faq.questions]]
question = "Can you guarantee our site will be cited by ChatGPT?"
answer = "No. And anyone who promises that is misleading you. AI citation is probabilistic, not controllable. What we can do is significantly increase the likelihood by making your content suitable for reuse as a reference. But there are no guarantees in this space."
open = true

[[faq.questions]]
question = "We already rank #1 for our keywords. Why isn't that enough?"
answer = "Search engines rank pages. AI generates explanations. These are fundamentally different systems. Your #1 ranking means Google thinks your page is relevant. It doesn't mean AI thinks your page is useful for supporting an explanation. Many top-ranking pages are never cited because they're promotional, poorly structured, or don't actually explain anything."

[[faq.questions]]
question = "How is this different from SEO?"
answer = "SEO optimizes for search rankings: keywords, backlinks, technical factors. AI optimization focuses on citation readiness: clarity, extractability, explanation quality. A page can rank well and never be cited. A page can rank poorly and be cited repeatedly. Different systems, different signals."

[[faq.questions]]
question = "What if AI just doesn't cite sources in our industry?"
answer = "This happens in some verticals. Part of the audit is determining whether citation opportunities exist at all. If AI consistently answers questions in your space without sources, we'll tell you — and recommend whether investing in this channel makes sense."

[[faq.questions]]
question = "How long before we see results?"
answer = "AI visibility changes are not instant. After implementing recommendations, it typically takes 4-8 weeks to see shifts in how AI tools reference your content. This isn't a switch you flip — it's positioning that builds over time."
